# Decision-Tree_with_python
 In this Notebook, we introduce the Decision Tree algorithm, and demonstrate how to effectively use this algorithm for both classification and regression problems. The Decision Tree algorithm is a simple algorithm that is easy to understand, since a higher-level representation of the data is iteratively constructed from the data. A decision tree provides a powerful, predictive model that can capture non-linear effects while also being easy to understand and explain.  In this notebook, we first explore the basic formalism of the decision tree algorithm, including a discussion on several important concepts that can be used to determine how the tree is constructed from a data set. Next, we introduce the use of the decision tree for classification problems by using the Iris data set. In this section we will examine feature importance, visualize the predictive tree, and discuss the effect of different hyperparameters, before switching to a more complex data set. Then, we will look at constructing a decision tree for regression, by using a new data set. Finally, we will briefly introduce several popular regression performance metrics.
